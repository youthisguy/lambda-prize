## About Logos

[Logos](https://logos.co) is a social movement and decentralised technology stack.

The Logos stack comprises three core layers:

- **Blockchain** - A privacy-preserving Layer 1 for execution, settlement, and coordination. The **Logos Execution Zone (LEZ)** is the programmable environment where decentralised applications run, featuring a unique separation of public and private state with shielded balances and private state as first-class primitives.
- **Storage** - Durable, censorship-resistant data availability powering fully decentralised apps and file sharing.
- **Messaging** - Private peer-to-peer communication that resists surveillance and censorship.

Together these form a unified, modular ecosystem, accessible through **Logos Core**, a plugin-based runtime that lets developers compose all three layers into privacy-preserving applications. 

## Prizes

All prizes live in the `[prizes/](prizes/)` directory. Each prize is a markdown file following the `LP-XXXX` naming convention.

### Proposing a New Prize

Prizes can currently only be proposed by Logos CCs. A separate process for sourcing ideas from the wider community is planned.

1. Copy `[prizes/LP-0000.md](prizes/LP-0000.md)` to `prizes/LP-XXXX.md`, where `XXXX` is the next available number.
2. Fill in all sections except **Prize Structure** (prize pool, revision date) — these are determined by the Logos team.
3. Open a pull request titled `LP-XXXX: <Prize Title>`.

Evaluation is first-come-first-served by default: the first submission that meets all success criteria wins. Single winner unless otherwise specified in the prize.

### Submitting a Solution

Solutions live in the `[solutions/](solutions/)` directory. To submit a solution:

1. Create a markdown file in `solutions/` matching the prize identifier — e.g., `solutions/LP-0001.md` for prize `LP-0001`.
2. Fill in the solution template: describe your approach, link to the repository containing the implementation, and attach any supporting materials.
3. Open a pull request titled `Solution: LP-XXXX — <Short Description>`.

If multiple solutions target the same prize, the first submission that satisfies all success criteria wins unless specified otherwise. A solution PR is timestamped by its opening date.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Parallel Society Launch Event**
>
> **λ**Prize launched at **Parallel Society**, a Logos-run event in Lisbon on **6–7 March 2026**, via a dedicated hackathon platform. Submissions for LP-0013 and LP-0014 were received during the event.
>
> Submissions through this repository are now open and follow the standard first-come-first-served process. However, Parallel Society submissions that are still being evaluated take precedence.

### Evaluation Policies

The following policies apply to **all** prizes unless a specific prize states otherwise.

**Submissions.** Each builder (or team) is allowed a maximum of **3 submissions** per prize, with at most **one submission/review per week**.

**Feedback.** Initial evaluation feedback is limited to a simple pass/fail result based on the success criteria. For more detailed guidance or technical discussion, builders are encouraged to participate in the community Discord. The #builder-hub channel is the best place to ask questions and engage with evaluators or other builders.

**Demo requirements.** Every submission that requires a demo must include a narrated video walkthrough in which the builder explains what they built and why, walks through the architecture and key implementation decisions, and demonstrates the full end-to-end flow. A silent screencast without explanation is not sufficient. Prize-specific demo content is listed in each prize's **Submission Requirements**.

- Submissions must be licensed under MIT or Apache 2.0.
- One submission per prize per participant/team.
- Logos retains sole discretion over evaluation and prize awards.
